# ML_car

A project that I created when I was learning Unity ML-Agents Toolkit and reinforcement learning. Project contains a simulation environment „Road“ (road with two turns) with a reinforcement learning agent (self-driving car) and a trained
model that drives the car through the road to the goal.
